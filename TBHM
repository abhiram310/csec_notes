 Recon and Application Methodology
 Note Taking: Xmind
 Project tracting is essential
 
 Xmind: notes and subnotes - mindmaps
 project Tesla
 
 
 1) Finding Seeds/ Roots
	Bugcrowd/Tesla
	Wide Recon : Understand the company - use crunchbase - automate using api - find acquisitions by the company - Twich is acquired by Verison, Revlo acquired by Twich
	
	Search for ASN of an org - Autonomous system numbers - bgp.he.net - check IPV4/IPV6
	ASN automation from cmd line: asnlookup tool/ Metabigor tool
	
	Enumeration of ASN - with AMASS - feed amass with an ASN number 
	amass intel -asn <number>
	This gives more seed data to add
	
	Reverse WhoIs  - with whoxy.com - has free api key
	Pulls up who owned the company in the past
	see other domains
	Reverse WhoIs - with Domlink - domlink.py
	
	Ad/Analytics Relationships - with builtwith.com
	find more seeds
	
	other tools to find top level Domains:
	Google Fu - get more seed domains by search copyrights or somthing
	
	Shodan - **for IOT stuff - unsecure**
	
 2)Finding Sub Domains
	Subdomain enumeration:
	link and Javascript discovery
	Subdomain scraping
	subdomain bruteforce
	
	Linked Discovery - with Burpsuite (PRO)
	target scope - 
	select all and spider them all to see if any return twhich in their home page
	
	^ automate that
	spider?
	Gospider and hakrawler
	
	Subdomainizer - for subdomain enumeration
	subscraper - scans subdomains with recursion
	
	Subdomain Scraping:
	next gen tools to find sub domains
	use google: site:twhich.tv -www.twhich.tv
	use AMASS and Subfinder tools for scraping subdomain data
	
	github enumeration :  uses our github token, gives subdomains found in github
	use github-search repo
	
	soshubgo
	
	scraping in cloud ranges:
	bufferover.run
	
	Subdomain Bruteforce:
	shuffleDNS tool
	
	Alteration Scanning
	
	Port Scanning:
	nmap
	masscan - a faster tool
	check for open ports
	then use nmap on the open ports
	dnmasscan to get ip to feed to masscan
	
	Service Scanning:
	Brutespray for default passwords
	
	Github Dorking
	jhaddix github dorking collection
	
	Screenshotting:
		eyewitness, Aquatone, httpscreenshot

	SubDomain Takeover:
	  can I takeover xyz on github
	  SubOver and nuclei
